title: "Hummus"
---

A Middle Eastern spread made from mashed chick peas, tahini, garlic, and lemon juice. The key to a smooth creamy texture is whipping up the tahini with lemon juice and water in a separate bowl.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups - cooked chickpeas (1 cup uncooked)
* 2-6 tablespoons - chickpea cooking liquid or water
* 1/2 cup - tahini
* 1/2 cup - finely chopped fresh parsley
* 4-5 cloves - garlic, mashed
* 1 teaspoon - salt
* 1 lemon - juiced

## Directions

### Mixing the Hummus
1. Mash the cooked chick peas with a fork.
1. Mix the garlic and salt in a separate bowl. Stir in the tahini. With a wooden spoon, beat in the lemon juice. Add a little cooking liquid or water and beat some more. Continue adding liquid and beating until the sauce has the consistency of thick mayonniase and holds its shape almost solidly in a spoon.
1. Beat the thini mixture from step 2 into the mashed chick peas. Add a little at a time, and continue beating until it's smooth. Add some more. At the end, if the mixture is too thick, beat in a little more liquid until it's spreadable.
1. Mix in the fresh parsley and taste. You might want to add a little more salt.

### Variation
1. Use sesame butter instead of tahini. The hummus will be denser.
